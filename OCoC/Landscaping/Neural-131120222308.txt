My landscape method:   1: text2img with a prompt that starts with "concept art of..."  and then try and stay less than around 15 words.  Example:  "concept art of an ancient island temple", 10 samples, Euler A, and around 16 images.  2: I choose one I like, send it to img2img, bump the steps to 20, generate images while fiddling with the denoising and adding a few more words to the prompt based on things I want it to pull out of the original.   3: I take the image to photoshop to "force" any changes that I'm not getting either by changing colors or creating inpainting masks.   4: back to SD where I do inpainting/img2img and I usually wind up switching the sampling method to DDIM.  5: ping pong between 3 and 4 while increasing the steps and lowering the batch count as I get closer to something I'm happy with.  6: put final image in Extras and upscale 4x
