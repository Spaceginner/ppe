I like to generate 512x512 or 896x512 with 30 steps on auto gen using dpm++2m for speed and ease of prompt adjustment. This gives me an image every 5 to 10 seconds. While it is spitting them out, if there is anything that isn't right I change the prompt. I am not fussed about things being perfect as I only like to generate high quality, high res images that have randomness to them... accepting any and all unique quirks of the images. Once the prompt is perfected I change the settings to use dpm++ 2s a karras on 100 steps using hi res fix on 2048x1152 first pass size 896x512. Leaving it on auto will give me high quality images I can then upscale in gigapixel ai to 8k
In the end my workflow is simply opening them in gigapixel from the onedrive folder and clicking start once the settings are on 0.12 and 0.80 respectively. I can then open them in GIMP, where I have a macro to auto export them in jpg quality 80 in 5 seconds by clicking one button. I can then share the image easily as it is an 8k image under 8mB
Note: auto image generation is constant even during gigapixel upscaling. No stopping required
